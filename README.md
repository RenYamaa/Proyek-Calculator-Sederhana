## 📝 Personal Notes
At first, I tried to learn both frontend and backend at the same time.
But I eventually realized it wasn’t the most effective way for me to learn — it was honestly a bit overwhelming 😅
So I decided to focus more on backend development, since that’s where my real interest lies.
At least I’ve learned something valuable: recognizing my limits and what I truly enjoy is also part of growing. 🚀
